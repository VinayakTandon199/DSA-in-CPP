Welcome! 🙌  
This repository is my personal log while learning and practicing DSA using C++. It includes handpicked problems from platforms like LeetCode, GFG, and more.

## 📌 Contents:
- 📂 Organized by topic: Arrays, Strings, Recursion, Linked Lists, Trees, etc.
- 🧠 Code with proper comments & approach explanation
- 🔁 Regular updates as I solve more problems

## 🎯 Goal:
Build a rock-solid foundation in problem-solving, master core DSA concepts, and prepare for tech interviews. Let's go! ⚡
